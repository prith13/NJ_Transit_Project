# NJ Transit Project
### There are many pain points around using NJ Transit: constant delays, frequent cancellations, congested waiting areas, and bottlenecks to get to the train platforms, to name a few. The latter two reasons are highly inconvenient for all passengers originating at Penn Station, and being able to predict what platform number a train comes to would help ease some of the daily stress surrounding NJ Transit use. 

#### 1. The goal of this project is to predict what platform number each train line will come to at different times of the day at Penn Station.
#### Ex: The Northeast Corridor (NEC) line will most likely arrive on platform number 9 at Penn Station for the scheduled 5:51 pm departure time.
